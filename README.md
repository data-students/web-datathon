### How to test locally?

1. Install the Node Package Manager (NPM).

2. Open a terminal inside this folder and run the following commands:
```
npm i
npm run start
```
3. Remember that the source code is in `./src` while the static assets are in `.public`.

### How do I deploy a new version?

1. Edit whatever you want. Do not manually edit anything in `./dist`. Its contents are automatically generated.

2. Commit your changes, the new version will automatically deploy!
